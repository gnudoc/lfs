# lfs
Some files I have found useful when building Linux From Scratch projects (linuxfromscratch.org)

They are mainly here to give me convenient tinkering access when I'm elsewhere.

They are very unlikely to be useful to anyone else but if you find them useful for some reason feel free to let me know.
